ASSIGNMENT 2 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
How to Get Started with This Assessment This       assessment          requires       you          to          sign       up          a       Xero          free          trial       account          to          complete   [https://www.xero.com/nz].

Once    you    have      signed      up      a      Xero      account,      you      can      create      a      trial   organisation. Please note that you can create as many trial organisations as you want, but each trial   organisation lasts only   30 days.

With the   number      of    students      involved,    it       is       impossible    for       lecturers    to       know    whether       a      missing   assignment    is       the      result      of    a       student    pulling       out       of    the       course,      deciding      to      forgo      the   assignment marks,   or   the   result   of a   potential   gremlin   in   the   system.
